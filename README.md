# Japanese Hiragana & Katakana Learning Tool

This project is an interactive web-based tool designed to help users learn Japanese Hiragana and Katakana characters. It presents a simple, user-friendly interface where learners can test their knowledge of these Japanese scripts by selecting the correct Romanized translations of displayed characters.

## Features

- **Interactive Quiz Format**: Users are presented with a Japanese character and must choose the correct Romanized translation from three options.
- **Progress Tracking**: A progress bar decreases over time, adding a sense of urgency and gamifying the learning experience.
- **Responsive Design**: The tool is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.
- **Dark Mode**: Users can switch to a dark mode to reduce eye strain, especially in low-light conditions.

## How It Works

- **Displaying Characters**: The application randomly selects a Hiragana or Katakana character and displays it to the user.
- **Choosing Answers**: Users click on one of the three buttons below the character to choose their answer.
- **Feedback on Selection**: The chosen button changes color based on the correctness of the answer - green for correct and red for incorrect. A shake animation is played for an incorrect answer.
- **Progress Bar**: A timer bar at the top of the quiz container adds time pressure, decreasing over a set time frame.
- **Dark Mode Toggle**: A switch is provided in the top right corner for users to toggle dark mode on or off.
